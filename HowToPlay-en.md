## Overview

There are two groups in game (spies and people who know the word). 
The goal for spies is to identify the word and the goal for the people is to identify the spies. 

## Step by Step
1. Use the app and select categories for the word
2. Enter the total number of players
3. Enter the number of spies (We recommend: at least 1  an at most 1/4 of the group)
4. Each person gets the phone and tap to reveal the word, for spies there is no word and only a message that tells them that they are the spy
5. There are two methods onward
    - We go around and each player start telling a fact about the word
    - We go around and each player choose another player and ask them something about the word
6. After few turns, people try to point out the spies, if spies are found correctly and they cant guess the word they will lose

## Notes
- During step 5 you can't ask questions directly about the word like "How many letters it has?"
- Try to ask more binary questions and answers with simple yes or no
- Try not to ask questions that requires previous knowledge like "Did I ever ate it?"
